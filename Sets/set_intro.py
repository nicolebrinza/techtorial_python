set = {1,3,10,9,1}

print(set)

#print(set[0])    it will print error

#Set itself is mutable object but we cannot store mutable object in a set
#string  boolean  integer    float   - are immutable
#list  - is mutable

# set1 = {1,9,3,4,[3,456,6,7]}   it will throw an error(unhashable type: 'list')
